# Parallel-FP-Growth
Implementation of Parallel FP Growth Algorithm on a Hadoop Cluster for mining frequent itemsets from a large transactional Database using Map Reduce Programming

# USE
Consider your transactional database consists of huge amount of transactions -

Eg -
1) Milk,Butter,Bread,Chicken.....
2) Chair,Table,Cloth....

and so on....

Output - 

Milk - ([Milk,Butter,Bread]:5),([Milk,Butter,Cornflakes]:7),([Milk,Flour,Chicken,Cheese,Bread]:11),...

Bread - ....

and so on...

Above output shows that Milk,Butter,Bread were bought together in 5 transactions , similarly Milk,Flour,Chicken,Cheese,Bread were brought together in 11 transactions

Top K itemsets (itemsets with highest count first ) are shown for each item where K is user defined

FP algorithm is used to find frequent itemsets along with their count for every item in this database which is considered to be frequent (this is specified by a minimum support count)

Parallelized version of this algorithm is implemented in Hadoop so that multiple computers in the hadoop cluster can process data parallely in a large database

Using these frequent itemsets for an item we can also design recommendation system when we buy an item like in e-Commerce Websites
